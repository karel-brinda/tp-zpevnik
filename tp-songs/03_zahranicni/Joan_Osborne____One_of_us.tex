If God had a name, what would it be?

And would you call it to his face

If you were faced with Him in all His glory?

What would you ask if you had just one question?

Yeah, yeah, God is great, yeah, yeah, God is good, yeah, yeah, yeah
\ks

What if God was one of us?

Just a slob like one of us?

Just a stranger on the bus

Trying to make his way home?

If God had a face, what would it look like?

And would you want to see, if seeing meant

that you would have to believe in things like heaven

And in Jesus and the saints and all the prophets?

Yeah, yeah, God is great, yeah, yeah, God is good, yeah, yeah, yeah

What if God was one of us?  Just a slob like one of us?

Just a stranger on the bus trying to make his way home?

Trying to make his way home...  Like up to heaven all alone...

Nobody calling on the phone...  Except for the Pope maybe in Rome

Yeah, yeah, God is great, yeah, yeah, God is good, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

What if God was one of us?  Just a slob like one of us?

Just a stranger on the bus trying to make his way home?

Just trying to make his way home...
Like a holy rolling stone...

Back up to heaven all alone...
Just trying to make his way home...

Nobody calling on the phone...
Except for the Pope maybe in Rome
