we go \Ch{E}{home.}

\Ch{Ami}{Just} a \Ch{D}{perfect} day,

Just a perfect day,
problems all left alone,

Weekenders on our own.
It's such fun.

Just a perfect day,
you made me forget myself.

I thought I was someone else,
someone good.

\bigskip

Oh it's such a perfect day,

I'm glad I spent it with you.

Oh such a perfect day,

You just keep me hanging on,

You just keep me hanging on.
