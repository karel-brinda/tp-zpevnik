Today is gonna be the day
that they're gonna throw it back to you

realized what you gotta do

Back beat, the word was on the street
that the fire in your heart is out

but you never really had a doubt

about you <Emi>now <G> <D> <A7>

And <C>all the roads we <D>have to walk are <Emi>winding

And <C>all the lights that <D>lead us there are <Emi>blinding

But I don't know <A7>how
