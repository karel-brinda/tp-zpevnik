Sunny, Yesterday my life was filled with rain

Sunny, You smiled at me and really eased the pain

Now the dark days are gone, and the bright days are here

My sunny one shines so sincere

Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, Thank you for the sunshine bouquet

Sunny, Thank you for the love you brought my way

You gave to me your all and all

And now I feel ten feet tall

Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, Thank you for the truth you let me see

Sunny, Thank you for the facts from A to Z

My life was torn like wind-blown sand

And a rock was formed when you held my hand (oh, sunny)

Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny, Thank you for the smile upon your face

Hmm, sunny, Thank you, thank you for the gleam that shows its grace

You're my spark of nature's fire

You're my sweet complete desire

Sunny one so true, yes, I love you
