<D>I once had a girl or should I say, <C>she once <G>had <D>me

She showed me her room, isn't it good, <C>Norwe<G>gian <D>wood

She <Dmi>asked me to stay and she told me to sit any<G>where

But <Dmi>I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a <Emi>chair <A7>

\zs
I sat on a rug biding my time, drinking her wine

We talked until two and then she said: ``It's time for bed''

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh

I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath
\ks

\zr
<D>And when I awoke I was alone, <C>this bird <G>had <D>flown

So I lit a fire, isn't it good, <C>Norwe<G>gian <D>wood?
