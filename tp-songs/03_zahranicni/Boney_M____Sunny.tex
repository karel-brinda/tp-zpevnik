Now the <Ami>dark days are gone, and the <C7>bright days are here

<F>My sunny one shines <Dmi>so sin<E>cere

<Ami>Sunny, one so <E7>true, I love <Ami>you

Sunny – thank you for the sunshine bouquet

Sunny – thank you for the love you brought my way

You gave to me your all and all

And now I feel ten feet tall

Sunny, one so true, I love you

Sunny – thank you for the truth you let me see

Sunny – thank you for the facts from A to Z

My life was torn like wind-blown sand

And a rock was formed when you held my hand

Sunny, one so true, I love you.

Sunny – thank you for the smile upon your face

Hmm, sunny – thank you, thank you for the gleam that shows its grace

You're my spark of nature's fire

You're my sweet complete desire

Sunny, one so true, yes, I love you
