\zp{Those were the days}{Mary Hopkin}

\zs
<Emi>Once upon a time there was a tavern

<E7>Where we used to raise a glass or <Ami>two

Remember how we laughed away the <Emi>hours

And <H7>think of all the great things we would do
\ks

\zr
Those were the <Emi>days, my friend

We thought they'd <Ami>never end

We'd sing and <D>dance for ever and a <G>day

We'd live the <Ami>life we choose

We'd fight and <Emi>never lose

For we were <H7>young and sure to have our <Emi>way

La la la la la la...
\kr

\zs
Then the busy years went rushing by us

We lost our starry notions on the way

If by chance I'd see you in the tavern

We'd smile at one another and we'd say
\ks

\zr\kr

\zs
Just tonight I stood before the tavern

Nothing seemed the way it used to be

In the glass I saw a strange reflection

Was that lonely woman really me?
\ks

\zr\kr

\zs
Through the door there came familiar laughter

I saw your face and heard you call my name

Oh, my friend, we're older but no wiser

For in our hearts the dreams are still the same
