Have you seen her dressed in <F>blue?

See the sky in front of you

And her face is lik a sail

Speck of white so fair and pale

Have you seen a lady fai<Bb>rer?

She comes in colors ev'ry<Eb>where

She combs her <Bb>hair

She's like a <Bb7>rain<Bb>bow

Coming, colors in the <Eb>air

Oh, every<Bb>where

She comes in <F>co<Bb>lors

\zs
Have you seen her all in gold?

Like a queen in days of old

She shoots her colors all around

Like a sunset going down

Have you seen a lady fairer?

She comes in colors ev'rywhere

She combs her hair

She's like a rainbow

Coming, colors in the air

Oh, everywhere

She comes in colors
