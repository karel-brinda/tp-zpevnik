<C>Remember that tanktop you bought <F>me
<C>You wrote 'You're <Fadd9>gorgeous' on it
<C>You took me to your <F>rented motor car
<C>And filmed me on the <Fadd9>bonnet
<C>You got me to hitch my <F>knees up
<C>And pulled my <Fadd9> legs apart

<C>You took an insta<F>matic camera
<C>And pulled my sleeves around my <Fadd9>heart
\ks

\zr
Because <C>you're <F>gorgeous, I'd <C>do anything for <Fadd9>you
Because <C>you're <F>gorgeous, I <C>know you'll get me <Fadd9>through
\kr

You said my clothes were sexy
You tore away my shirt
You rubbed an ice-cube on my chest
And snapped me 'til it hurt

<C>  <F>  <C>  <Fadd9> x 3

Ba, ba, <C>ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, <F>ba, ba, ba ba
ba, ba, <C>ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, <Fadd9>ba  a ha

You said I wasn't cheap
You paid me twenty pounds
You promised to put me in a magazine
On every table, in every lounge
\ks

\zr
Because you're gorgeous, I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous, I know you'll get me through

Because you're gorgeous, I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous, I know you'll get me, know you'll get me through
know you'll get me through, know you'll get me through
know you'll get me, know you'll get me through
I know you'll get me, know you'll get me, know you'll get me through
Because you're gorgeous, I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous, I know you'll get me through
Because you're gorgeous, I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous, I know you'll get me, know you'll get me through
