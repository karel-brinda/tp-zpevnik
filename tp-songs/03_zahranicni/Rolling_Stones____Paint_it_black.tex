<Em>I see a red door and I <B>want it painted black

<Em>No colors anymore, I want <B>them to turn black

<Em>I <D>see the <G>girls walk <D>by dressed <Em>in their summer clothes

<Em>I <D>have to <G>turn my <D>head un<A>til my darkness <B>goes

\zs
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black

With flowers and my love, both never to come back

I see people turn their heads and quickly look away

Like a new born baby it just happens every day
\ks

\zs
I look inside myself and see my heart is black

I see my red door, I must have it painted black

Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts

It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black
\ks

\zs
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue

I could not foresee this thing happening to you

If I look hard enough into the setting sun

My love will laugh with me before the morning comes
\ks

\zs
I see a red door and I want it painted black

No colors anymore I want them to turn black

I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes

I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
\ks

\zs
I want to see it painted, painted black

Black as night, black as coal

I want to see the sun blotted out from the sky

I want to see it painted, painted, painted, painted black, yeah
\ks
